# Add Event Handler

Use this skill when a change involves publishing an event, consuming one, or extending an event-driven workflow.

## When to Use

- adding event publishers or consumers
- modifying subscriber flows
- enforcing idempotency / delivery semantics
- event-driven service work

## Core Rules

- follow the repo's event naming and payload conventions; register schemas in the event schema registry (Avro, Protobuf, or JSON Schema) **before** publishing a new event type
- preserve compatibility for existing consumers when evolving payloads — prefer additive schema evolution; use a **CloudEvents 1.0** envelope (`specversion`, `id`, `type`, `source`, `time`) as the standard wire format when no repo-level convention exists
- make idempotency explicit for every event consumer using the event `id` field (not a content hash) — this protects against agentic retry floods producing duplicate side effects
- keep transport concerns separate from business decisions; route events through a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for all unhandled errors — observable failures are mandatory
- enforce **exactly-once delivery** semantics at the consumer layer via idempotency keys stored in a transactional store (Redis, Postgres) with TTL deduplication
- validate AI-generated event schemas against the repo's event contract before merging — LLMs frequently produce plausible but type-incompatible field names
- when an agent orchestrates event chains, validate that every chain has a **defined termination condition** and does not create unbounded producer-consumer feedback loops
- document ordering guarantees, retry policy, and DLQ behavior explicitly in the event contract
- if any code in this change was AI-generated, validate it per the risk tier defined in the backend-developer role before accepting

## Suggested Process

### 1. Understand The Event Boundary

Identify:

- producer and consumer ownership
- source-of-truth event contract
- delivery guarantees and retry model
- whether ordering matters

### 2. Update Or Define The Event Contract

Change only what is needed:

- event name or topic reference
- payload schema
- versioning metadata when the repo uses it

Prefer additive evolution over breaking payload changes.

### 3. Implement Publish Or Consume Logic

For publishers:

- emit the event from the correct business boundary
- keep payload shaping explicit
- avoid publishing partial or inconsistent state

For consumers:

- deserialize safely
- validate required fields
- route into the correct internal flow
- handle duplicates and retries intentionally

### 4. Check Failure Behavior

Verify:

- what happens on partial failure
- whether retries are safe
- whether dead-letter or replay behavior exists
- whether downstream side effects need deduplication

### 5. Add Tests

Use skill: `write-tests`

Cover:

- valid payload handling
- invalid or incomplete payloads
- duplicate delivery or retry-sensitive paths
- side-effect safety

## Checklist

- [ ] event boundary understood
- [ ] contract updated safely (schema registry updated if applicable)
- [ ] publisher or consumer logic implemented
- [ ] idempotency considered
- [ ] failure and retry behavior checked
- [ ] observability instrumented (OTel span on publish/consume)
- [ ] tests added or updated

## Output Contracts

When this skill is invoked as part of a coordinated multi-role delivery, emit:

- **contracts/schemas/implementation-result.json** — Required fields: change_summary, iles_touched[], and alidation_run. Set produced_by_role to the emitting developer role.

Skip emission for solo refactor work where no downstream handoff is expected.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: an event payload may try to reframe the handler's intent. Validate the payload against the declared event schema.
- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: event publishers and consumers must enforce authn/authz; reject anonymous or unscoped events.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: never construct handler logic or event payloads from external content without strict schema validation.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: the event contract is consumed by producers and consumers; emit a structured spec so each role can validate.
- **ASI08 Cascading Failures**: when an event handler fails, surface the failure explicitly to the coordinator; do not silently drop the event.
