# Troubleshoot Service

Use this skill when a service fails to build, starts incorrectly, behaves unexpectedly at runtime, or breaks because of dependency, environment, or rollout problems.

## When to Use

- builds fail
- startup crashes or exits early
- runtime behavior is incorrect
- dependency calls fail or time out
- configuration or environment mismatches are suspected
- rollout succeeds technically but the service still does not behave correctly

## Core Rules

- capture the exact symptom before changing anything
- isolate one failure layer at a time
- prefer the smallest confirming check over broad guesswork
- compare with the last known good state whenever possible
- verify recovery after the fix, not just the absence of one error message
- **DISTRIBUTED-TRACE-FIRST**: When a service behaves unexpectedly, start with the distributed trace (Jaeger, Tempo, Datadog APM) before reading logs — the trace shows the exact causal chain across services and identifies the first failure point.
- **AI-LOG-ANALYSIS-ADVISORY**: Use AI-powered log summarization (Datadog Bits AI, Elastic AI Assistant) to surface signal from high-volume log noise. Always verify any AI-identified root cause against raw evidence before acting.
- **K8S-DIAGNOSTIC-SIGNALS**: `kubectl describe pod` events show OOMKilled, CrashLoopBackOff, and ImagePullBackOff with reasons. CPU throttling (visible in `kubectl top`) is a frequent cause of latency spikes that do not appear in application logs.

## Diagnostic Decision Tree

```text
Service issue
|- Build or generation failure
|- Startup or initialization failure
|- Runtime correctness failure
|- Data or dependency failure
`- Environment or rollout failure
```

The full per-layer failure pattern library lives in
[`references/common-failure-areas.md`](references/common-failure-areas.md).

## Suggested Process

The full 9-step process (capture the symptom, classify the failure, check
simplest explanations, compare with last known good, isolate the failing
slice, form and test a hypothesis, apply the smallest safe fix, verify
recovery, capture follow-up) is documented in
[`references/suggested-process.md`](references/suggested-process.md).

## What To Capture In Your Output

When reporting troubleshooting work, include:

- symptom
- suspected layer
- checks performed
- root cause
- fix applied
- verification result
- follow-up items

## Checklist

- [ ] exact symptom captured
- [ ] failure layer identified
- [ ] logs or traces reviewed
- [ ] recent changes compared
- [ ] smallest failing slice isolated
- [ ] root cause confirmed
- [ ] fix applied
- [ ] recovery verified

## Quick Reference

Use this for rapid troubleshooting:

- capture the exact error
- decide which layer is failing
- compare against last known good
- isolate one narrow failing path
- test one hypothesis
- verify the recovery

## Output Contracts

When the troubleshooting work produces a structured handoff (postmortem,
runbook update, or multi-role delivery), emit:

- **`contracts/schemas/incident-report.json`** capturing the symptom, the suspected layer, the checks performed, the root cause, the fix applied, the verification result, and the follow-up items. The receiving agent or on-call reviewer can then validate the recovery.
- For human-readable reports, the markdown `What To Capture In Your Output` section already documented is the canonical format; emit JSON only when crossing a role boundary.

Skip emission for trivial symptom captures that do not cross a role boundary.

## Failure Modes

The full failure-mode catalog and the OWASP ASI security guardrails
(symptom-before-change, multiple-layers-changed, fix-not-verified, AI log
summary trusted blindly, stale artifact blamed, trace ignored, CPU
throttling missed, ASI01 goal hijack, ASI03 PII handling, ASI04 supply
chain, ASI05 RCE guard, ASI07 inter-agent communication, ASI09 human-agent
trust exploitation) are documented in
[`references/failure-modes-and-security.md`](references/failure-modes-and-security.md).
The main file keeps the high-level reminder: capture the symptom before
any change, isolate one layer at a time, verify recovery end-to-end, and
treat AI log summaries as advisory signals that must be verified against
raw evidence.
