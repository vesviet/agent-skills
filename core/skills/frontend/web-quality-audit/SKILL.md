# Web Quality Audit

Conduct systematic web performance and runtime quality audits, evaluating Core Web Vitals thresholds, profiling DevTools performance traces for main-thread bottlenecks, and enforcing automated Lighthouse CI regression gates.

## When to Use

- Auditing web applications prior to major release milestones or production deployments
- Diagnosing degraded Core Web Vitals (CWV) metrics in Google Search Console or real-user telemetry
- Profiling interaction lag, input latency, and sluggish UI responses (INP optimization)
- Detecting layout shifts caused by unsized images, dynamic banners, or web font swapping (CLS)
- Integrating automated quality thresholds into continuous integration pipelines

## Core Rules

- **Core Web Vitals Metric Standards**:
  - Web quality audits must evaluate real-user and lab performance against strict 75th-percentile standards:
    - *Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)*: $\le 2.5\text{s}$ (Good), $2.5\text{s} - 4.0\text{s}$ (Needs Improvement), $> 4.0\text{s}$ (Poor).
    - *Interaction to Next Paint (INP)*: $\le 200\text{ms}$ (Good), $200\text{ms} - 500\text{ms}$ (Needs Improvement), $> 500\text{ms}$ (Poor).
    - *Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)*: $\le 0.10$ (Good), $0.10 - 0.25$ (Needs Improvement), $> 0.25$ (Poor).
    - *First Input Delay / TTFB*: Time to First Byte $\le 800\text{ms}$.
- **Main-Thread Long Task & LoAF Profiling**:
  - Utilize the Long Animation Frames (LoAF) API and Performance Timeline to isolate tasks $> 50\text{ms}$ that freeze the main thread.
  - Total Blocking Time (TBT) during initial load must not exceed $200\text{ms}$ on simulated mobile profiles.
  - Yield main-thread control via `scheduler.yield()` or microtask chunking during expensive computation loops.
- **DOM Complexity and Payload Budget**:
  - Total DOM tree elements must remain under $1,400$ nodes.
  - Maximum DOM tree nesting depth must not exceed $32$ levels.
  - Critical JavaScript bundle slice for initial interactive view must not exceed $150\text{KB}$ gzipped.
- **Lighthouse CI Quality Gate Baselines**:
  - Automated CI release gates require the following minimal median audit scores across 3 consecutive runs:
    - Performance: $\ge 90$
    - Accessibility: $\ge 95$
    - Best Practices: $\ge 90$
    - SEO: $\ge 95$

## Suggested Process

1. **Establish Profiling Baseline**:
   - Run Lighthouse CI under simulated mobile conditions (Moto G4 / 4x CPU throttling, slow 4G network).
   - Record baseline scores for LCP, INP, CLS, and TBT.
2. **Profile Critical Rendering Path (LCP)**:
   - Identify the LCP element (hero image, heading text, or video poster).
   - Ensure priority resource hints (`fetchpriority="high"`, `<link rel="preload">`) are applied to the LCP asset.
   - Verify server response time (TTFB) and eliminate render-blocking CSS/JavaScript assets.
3. **Audit Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**:
   - Profile event handler durations during high-frequency user interactions (clicks, keyboard input, filtering).
   - Deconstruct long tasks: separate synchronous visual feedback from asynchronous state synchronization.
4. **Inspect Layout Stability (CLS)**:
   - Audit dynamic UI elements, banners, and late-loading images for explicit `width`, `height`, or `aspect-ratio` CSS rules.
   - Configure font loading with `font-display: optional` or size-adjust font fallbacks to eliminate layout pop.
5. **Compile Audit Report & Enforce Release Gate**:
   - Package findings, CWV measurements, and remediation directives into the standardized audit report.
   - Fail CI pipelines if any metric breaches the "Poor" classification threshold.

## Output Contracts

When completing a web quality assessment, emit `contracts/schemas/performance-audit.json`:
- `audit_id`: Unique identifier for the web quality audit run.
- `url`: Target web endpoint or route evaluated.
- `metrics`: Measured values for LCP, INP, CLS, TBT, and TTFB.
- `lighthouse_scores`: Scores across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.
- `verdict`: Gate result (`pass`, `fail`, `warn`).

## Failure Modes

- **Unsized Media Shifting Layout (CLS Failure)**: Loading dynamic cards or banner images without reserved aspect-ratio containers, causing elements to push content down. Mitigation: declare CSS `aspect-ratio` or inline dimensions on all media tags.
- **Long JavaScript Tasks Freezing INP**: Executing complex client-side search or sorting synchronously on the main thread. Mitigation: move heavy data processing to Web Workers or chunk processing with `scheduler.yield()`.
- **Render-Blocking Third-Party Scripts**: Loading analytics or tracking libraries in `<head>` without `defer` or `async`, delaying LCP. Mitigation: load third-party scripts dynamically via deferred web workers (e.g. Partytown).
- **Flaky Single-Run Benchmarks**: Relying on one Lighthouse run subject to network jitter. Mitigation: take the median of 3 to 5 independent test executions.

## Checklist

- [ ] LCP verified $\le 2.5\text{s}$ with priority resource preloading on hero elements
- [ ] INP verified $\le 200\text{ms}$ with zero main-thread blocking tasks exceeding 50ms
- [ ] CLS verified $\le 0.10$ with explicit aspect-ratio or dimensions on all media assets
- [ ] DOM size verified under 1,400 total nodes and maximum depth under 32 levels
- [ ] Total Blocking Time (TBT) kept under 200ms on simulated mobile throttling profiles
- [ ] Automated Lighthouse CI scores meet or exceed targets (Perf 90, A11y 95, SEO 95)
- [ ] Font loading configured with font-display and fallback metric overrides to prevent FOIT/FOUT
- [ ] Audit findings compiled and validated against `performance-audit.json`
