# Motion Performance Engineering

Engineer fluid 60fps and 120fps user interface animations by enforcing GPU composite-only transforms, calibrating spring physics timing curves, budgeting main-thread render times, and honoring system accessibility motion preferences.

## When to Use

- Implementing interactive page transitions, modal drawers, dialog animations, and micro-interactions
- Eliminating frame drops, layout jank, and stutter in complex component trees
- Calibrating spring physics parameters (stiffness, damping, mass) for tactile UI responsiveness
- Optimizing GPU memory usage and layer promotion on mobile web applications
- Adding comprehensive `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` fallbacks across animation systems

## Core Rules

- **Composite-Only Property Invariant**:
  - Animations running on continuous timelines or touch gestures must animate **only** compositor-driven properties:
    - `transform` (translation, rotation, scale)
    - `opacity`
  - Never animate layout-triggering properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`, `flex-basis`).
  - Never animate paint-triggering properties (`box-shadow`, `border-width`, `background-color`) during 60fps gesture tracks. Use pseudo-element opacity fades or scale transforms instead.
- **Layer Promotion and VRAM Hygiene**:
  - Apply `will-change: transform, opacity` or GPU promotion (`transform: translateZ(0)`) only immediately before or during active motion.
  - Remove layer promotion when motion completes to avoid unconstrained GPU texture memory allocation, which degrades mobile performance.
- **Spring Physics Calibration**:
  - UI spring transitions must settle crisply without perceived sluggishness or sustained oscillation:
    - *Snappy Micro-interactions*: Stiffness $k \approx 400$, damping ratio $\zeta \approx 0.85$, duration $\le 250\text{ms}$.
    - *Page / Sheet Transitions*: Stiffness $k \approx 280$, damping ratio $\zeta \approx 0.90$, duration $300\text{ms}-400\text{ms}$.
    - Damping ratio $\zeta < 0.70$ (underdamped rubber-banding) is prohibited in enterprise and data applications.
- **Frame Budget Allocation**:
  - At 60Hz, each frame must complete within a $16.6\text{ms}$ window. Main-thread execution must not exceed $10\text{ms}$ per frame to preserve compositor headroom.
  - At 120Hz (ProMotion / high refresh displays), total frame budget is $8.3\text{ms}$; main thread must settle under $5\text{ms}$.
- **Accessibility & Reduced Motion**:
  - Every transition and animation must declare an immediate fallback under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`:
    - Replace spatial transforms with instantaneous state switches or gentle opacity-only crossfades ($\le 150\text{ms}$).
    - Disable continuous looping animations (pulse, spin, marquee).

## Suggested Process

1. **Audit Animation Property Targets**:
   - Inspect CSS and animation library drivers (e.g. Framer Motion, CSS `@keyframes`).
   - Replace any layout properties (`top`, `height`, etc.) with equivalent `transform: translate3d(...)` or `scale(...)`.
2. **Configure GPU Composited Layers**:
   - Promote animating surfaces to independent composited layers.
   - Profile DevTools Layers panel to ensure layers do not unexpectedly trigger full-document paint passes.
3. **Calibrate Spring Curves and Timing**:
   - Select appropriate stiffness and damping values to achieve critical damping ($\zeta \approx 0.85-0.95$).
   - Verify that animations settle cleanly within the 250ms–400ms target window.
4. **Implement Accessibility Reduced-Motion Fallbacks**:
   - Wrap motion definitions in reduced-motion media queries or use accessible utility hooks.
   - Verify that navigation and state changes remain fully functional with motion disabled.
5. **Benchmark Frame Rate with Performance Trace**:
   - Record a Chrome DevTools performance trace during rapid interaction sequences.
   - Verify zero Long Animation Frames (LoAF) and consistent 60fps/120fps rendering without dropped frames.

## Output Contracts

When completing motion performance implementations, emit `contracts/schemas/implementation-result.json`:
- `feature_id`: Animation or component performance task identifier.
- `files_modified`: Code files updated with hardware-accelerated transitions.
- `test_results`: Verification of 60fps frame rate and `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance.

## Failure Modes

- **Layout Thrashing in Animation Loops**: Reading DOM geometry (`offsetHeight`, `getBoundingClientRect`) while mutating styles in requestAnimationFrame, triggering forced synchronous layouts. Mitigation: read geometry once before starting the animation loop.
- **Layer Explosion (VRAM Exhaustion)**: Applying `will-change: transform` indiscriminately across hundreds of list items, crashing mobile GPU memory. Mitigation: promote only the actively animating element or visible viewport slice.
- **Underdamped Spring Oscillations**: Springs with low damping bouncing excessively, frustrating users attempting to click buttons. Mitigation: enforce critically damped spring configurations ($\zeta \ge 0.80$).
- **Missing Reduced-Motion Support**: Leaving vestibular-disorder triggers active for users requesting reduced motion. Mitigation: automated linting or CSS test suite verifying reduced-motion overrides.

## Checklist

- [ ] All animations and transitions restricted exclusively to `transform` and `opacity`
- [ ] No layout-triggering properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `margin`) animated on continuous timelines
- [ ] `will-change` applied strictly to actively animating surfaces and removed on completion
- [ ] Spring parameters calibrated with critical damping ($\zeta \ge 0.80$) settling in $< 400\text{ms}$
- [ ] Main-thread render duration budgeted under 10ms per frame to prevent dropped frames
- [ ] Complete `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` fallbacks implemented for all motion
- [ ] Looping animations (pulsing badges, spinning indicators) silenced when reduced motion is preferred
- [ ] Verified smooth 60fps/120fps playback in DevTools Performance panel trace
