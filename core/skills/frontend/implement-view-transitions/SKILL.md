# Implement View Transitions

Use this skill to implement, optimize, and audit native view transitions, route-level page animations, shared element morphs, and layout displacement animations across React 19, Next.js, and Astro.

## When to Use

- implementing fluid hierarchical page navigations (list -> detail -> list) with directional slides
- authoring shared element morphs between source cards and destination hero sections
- animating Suspense reveal transitions (skeleton -> content) without layout jumps
- implementing layout displacement morphs on dynamic list additions, removals, or reordering
- optimizing web animation performance to protect Interaction to Next Paint (INP < 200ms)
- enforcing WCAG 2.2 AA `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance across all view transitions

## Core Rules

- **Composited Motion Only**: animations attached to `::view-transition-old` and `::view-transition-new` must strictly animate `transform` and `opacity`; never animate layout geometry (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`)
- **Enforce INP Performance Budget (< 200ms)**: the DOM mutation callback inside `startViewTransition` must execute in under 50ms without synchronous long tasks; wrap non-urgent transitions in `React.startTransition` and chunk streaming work with `scheduler.yield()`
- **Apply `default="none"` Discipline**: all named and type-keyed `<ViewTransition>` boundaries must specify `default="none"`, explicitly opting into only the transitions they are intended to handle
- **Precede DOM Nodes**: in React, `<ViewTransition>` must wrap content *before any DOM nodes* to activate enter/exit transitions; never wrap `<ViewTransition>` inside an un-animated host `<div>`
- **Enforce Global Uniqueness for Transition Names**: `view-transition-name` (or the `name` prop on `<ViewTransition>`) must be globally unique across active elements; suffix list and entity elements with dynamic IDs (`hero-image-${item.id}`)
- **Isolate Persistent Elements**: persistent headers, sidebars, and sticky controls must be pulled out of the `root` transition group by assigning unique `viewTransitionName` identifiers and suppressing their animations
- **Mandate Reduced Motion Fallback**: every view transition stylesheet must declare an `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block disabling or instant-fading animations
- detailed recipes and Next.js/Astro patterns: [`references/view-transitions-and-motion-specs.md`](references/view-transitions-and-motion-specs.md)

## Suggested Process

### 1. Audit Navigation Map & Candidate Surfaces
Scan the route graph. Identify navigation triggers (`<Link>`, `router.push`), navigation directions (forward, back), Suspense boundaries, shared visual elements (thumbnails -> hero headers), and persistent app shell elements (header, sidebar, sticky dock).

### 2. Add Global CSS Recipes & Reduced Motion Overrides
Incorporate standardized view transition keyframes and classes into the global stylesheet. Ensure `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` is active before authoring custom animations.

### 3. Isolate App Shell & Persistent Elements
Assign explicit `viewTransitionName` styles to header, navigation, and persistent containers. Apply persistent isolation CSS to prevent shell flickering during page transitions.

### 4. Implement Directional Route Transitions
Tag navigation events with `addTransitionType` (`nav-forward`, `nav-back`) inside `startTransition`. Wrap page components in reusable type-keyed `<DirectionalTransition>` components.

### 5. Wire Shared Element Morphs
Assign matching `name={`entity-hero-${id}`}` props to source and destination elements. Set `share="morph"` and configure appropriate fallback `enter`/`exit` classes for routes where no pair forms.

### 6. Verify Core Web Vitals & Interaction Responsiveness
Measure Interaction to Next Paint (INP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) under simulated 4x CPU throttling. Verify animations run at 60/120fps on compositor thread with zero layout thrashing.

## Checklist

- [ ] view transitions animate exclusively composited properties (`transform`, `opacity`)
- [ ] Interaction to Next Paint verified under budget (INP < 200ms)
- [ ] all targeted `<ViewTransition>` boundaries declare `default="none"`
- [ ] `<ViewTransition>` components placed before any host DOM nodes
- [ ] `name` attributes for shared elements are dynamically scoped and globally unique
- [ ] persistent headers and navigation bars isolated with unique `viewTransitionName`
- [ ] `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` overrides verified in browser
- [ ] hierarchical navigations mapped with typed directional transitions (`nav-forward` / `nav-back`)
- [ ] fallback animations defined for shared elements when matching target is absent
- [ ] `performance-audit.json` and `implementation-result.json` emitted and validated

## Output Contracts

When this skill is invoked as part of a coordinated frontend slice, emit:

- **`contracts/schemas/ui-component-spec.json`** — Documents transition boundaries, names, triggers, and type maps.
- **`contracts/schemas/performance-audit.json`** — Records INP, LCP, CLS, and compositor frame-rate measurements.
- **`contracts/schemas/implementation-result.json`** — Records files modified, CSS recipes installed, and behavioral test evidence.

## Failure Modes

- **Layout Thrashing & Frame Drops**: CSS animates `height` or `width` during transition, dropping frames below 30fps. Mitigation: code review rejects layout property animations; replace with scale/translate transforms.
- **Duplicate Name Collision**: two active items render `name="hero-image"`, breaking transitions. Mitigation: require dynamic ID parameterization (`name={`hero-${id}`}`).
- **Unintended Global Crossfade**: an unconfigured `<ViewTransition>` fades every time a background revalidation occurs. Mitigation: enforce `default="none"`.
- **Persistent Header Jump**: sticky navigation header stretches and slides during page change. Mitigation: pull header into independent transition group via `viewTransitionName: "header"`.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: do not allow transition type parameters to be populated directly from untrusted query strings without strict allowlist validation.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: validate dynamic `name` attributes against sanitization patterns to prevent CSS injection via unescaped string interpolation.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: emit structured `performance-audit.json` documenting INP metrics for Reviewer and Technical Lead verification.
