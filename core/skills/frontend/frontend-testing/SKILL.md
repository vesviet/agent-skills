# Frontend Testing

Use this skill when adding or updating tests for frontend components, pages, routes, or client-driven state.

## When to Use

- frontend behavior needs regression coverage or UI release confidence
- adding modern Playwright v1.48+ E2E, HAR network replay, or component tests
- enforcing automated WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility gates and keyboard focus management
- implementing font-stabilized visual regression snapshots across viewports
- intercepting client network requests via MSW v2 transport-level handlers
- validating complex state transitions, optimistic UI updates, or form error flows
- optimizing multi-viewport, theme, and localization UI permutation matrices via pairwise combinatorial testing
- diagnosing and isolating flaky frontend interactions or race conditions using 4-phase systematic debugging
- **Playwright v1.48+ web-first automation mandatory**
- **MSW v2 transport-level interception mandatory**
- **WCAG 2.2 AA zero-violations CI gate mandatory**

## Core Rules

- **User-facing behavior over internal implementation**:
  - test observable user outcomes; never assert on internal component state, private methods, or CSS classes
  - use accessibility-first query priority: `getByRole` > `getByLabelText` > `getByText` > `getByTestId`
  - ban querying by raw CSS selectors or DOM IDs unless targeting third-party uninstrumented embeds
- **Modern Playwright v1.48+ web-first automation**:
  - make async assertions deterministic with auto-waiting locators (`expect(locator).toBeVisible()`, `expect(locator).toBeEnabled()`)
  - strictly ban arbitrary delays (`sleep()`, `page.waitForTimeout()`); wait for explicit UI state or network idle predicates
  - configure Trace Viewer to capture diagnostics on failure (`trace: 'retain-on-failure'`) along with console logs and network traffic
  - record and replay deterministic network interactions via HAR (`page.routeFromHAR()`) for external third-party API stability
  - leverage Playwright Component Testing (`@playwright/experimental-ct-*`) or Vitest Browser Mode for real DOM rendering without full browser stack overhead
- **MSW v2 transport-level network interception**:
  - intercept network requests via MSW v2 (`setupServer` for Node/Vitest, `setupWorker` for browser dev/Playwright)
  - author handlers with standard fetch `http.*` methods and typed `HttpResponse.json()`
  - enforce `onUnhandledRequest: 'error'` to catch unmocked requests and prevent silent leakage to live backends
  - simulate realistic network variations: latency injection, HTTP 4xx/5xx errors, network disconnection, and malformed payloads
- **Automated WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility gates**:
  - run `@axe-core/playwright` (`AxeBuilder.withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag22aa']).analyze()`) in CI with zero violations
  - verify keyboard focus containment: Tab cycling must be trapped within modal dialogs, flyouts, and drawers while open
  - verify focus restoration: pressing Escape must dismiss the overlay and restore keyboard focus to the triggering element
  - validate accessibility trees and semantic landmarks using Playwright ARIA snapshots (`expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot()`)
- **Font-stabilized visual regression snapshots**:
  - await web font readiness before capturing screenshots (`await page.evaluate(() => document.fonts.ready)`)
  - suppress CSS animations, transitions, and blinking text carets (`animations: 'disabled'`)
  - mask volatile or dynamic elements (timestamps, random avatars, counters) using `mask: [locator]`
  - execute snapshot suites inside containerized headless Linux environments (Docker) to eliminate cross-OS rasterization diffs
  - configure tight pixel difference tolerances (`maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.002`) to catch genuine visual defects while ignoring subpixel jitter
- **AI & LLM-generated UI component resilience**:
  - test empty, truncated, streaming, and malformed LLM responses explicitly; never assume well-formed model output
  - establish visual regression baselines before merging AI-generated components to catch missing active/hover/focus states
  - mandate automated axe-core scans on AI-generated UI to catch syntactically valid but semantically broken ARIA attributes
- **Pairwise UI matrix & systematic defect isolation**:
  - use `combinatorial-testing` to generate pairwise covering arrays across viewports, user permissions, and component states
  - use `systematic-debugging` to isolate non-deterministic UI flakiness, race conditions, and state transition errors
- **Scope discipline & change governance**:
  - keep test scope minimal while proving risk coverage; never commit or push test changes without explicit confirmation

## Choose The Right Test Scope

### Component Tests

Best for:
- isolated rendering variants, props validation, and interactive state changes
- Playwright Component Testing (`@playwright/experimental-ct-*`) or Vitest Browser Mode
- disabled, loading, and error states; a11y-sensitive markup and focus traps
- validating ARIA states, role attributes, and keyboard focus handling at the unit level
- rapid feedback during component development without full app bundling

### Page Or Route Tests

Best for:
- route data loading, navigation guards, and auth session state
- layout integration, responsive breakpoints, and client-side URL routing transitions
- mock API contract integration with MSW v2 handlers or recorded HAR replays
- validating page-level metadata, canonical tags, and breadcrumb hierarchy

### End-To-End Or Journey Tests

Best for:
- high-risk end-to-end user journeys spanning multiple page boundaries
- cross-browser verification (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with Playwright Trace Viewer enabled
- multi-role interactions (e.g. buyer checkout and admin order review in parallel contexts)
- critical path release confidence (use sparingly when smaller tests provide sufficient proof)

## Suggested Process

### 1. Inspect Existing Frontend Tests

Match local patterns for:
- test runner and browser provider (Playwright v1.48+, Vitest browser mode)
- render helpers, wrapper providers, router mocks, and test fixtures
- network mocking setup (MSW v2 server/worker handlers and request schemas)
- assertion libraries, custom matchers, and accessibility assertions
- visual snapshot configurations and containerized execution parameters

### 2. Identify Risky Behaviors & Accessibility Invariants

At minimum, evaluate:
- primary rendering paths and interactive state transitions
- error, empty, loading, timeout, and degraded network states
- optimistic UI updates, local cache invalidations, and form validation boundaries
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance: color contrast, keyboard focus traps, Escape key restoration
- visual regression sensitivity (custom web fonts, transitions, dynamic date/avatar content)
- internationalization and bidirectional text (RTL/LTR) layout reflows

### 3. Choose A Stable Dependency Strategy

Use the lightest valid approach:
- MSW v2 transport-level handlers with `onUnhandledRequest: 'error'` for deterministic API mocking
- HAR recording and replay (`page.routeFromHAR()`) for external third-party API stability
- isolated browser contexts per test worker to prevent cookie, session, or local storage leakage
- minimal deterministic fixture data for component and route state
- containerized headless browser environment (Docker Linux) for reproducible visual snapshots

### 4. Write Deterministic UI & Accessibility Tests

Keep tests stable by:
- relying on web-first auto-waiting locators (`toBeVisible()`) instead of arbitrary delays
- validating modal keyboard focus containment (Tab cycling) and trigger restoration on Escape
- asserting zero axe-core violations with `@axe-core/playwright` (`AxeBuilder.analyze()`)
- stabilizing visual snapshots with `document.fonts.ready`, `animations: 'disabled'`, and element masking
- verifying ARIA structure with Playwright snapshot assertions (`toMatchAriaSnapshot()`)

### 5. Run Validation & Capture Diagnostic Artifacts

Execute:
- targeted component and route tests first for fast feedback loops
- full browser suite with Playwright Trace Viewer capturing failure traces (`trace: 'retain-on-failure'`)
- inspect Playwright Trace Viewer timeline, network panel, and DOM snapshots on failure
- automated WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility audit and containerized visual snapshot comparisons
- linter and typecheck before finalizing test deliverables

## Failure Modes

- **Coverage theater**: high line coverage without critical failure paths. Mitigation: Testing Trophy + mutation score ≥ 75-80% via Stryker.
- **Font anti-aliasing flakiness**: cross-platform 1px diffs. Mitigation: `document.fonts.ready`, disable animations, containerized Linux, `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.002`.
- **Modal focus trap & loss**: focus escapes modal or lost on close. Mitigation: `@axe-core/playwright` CI gate, Tab containment, Escape focus restoration.
- **Network leakage**: unmocked requests causing flaky timeouts. Mitigation: MSW v2 `onUnhandledRequest: 'error'`, HAR replay.
- **Flaky sleep-based waits**: `waitForTimeout()` race conditions. Mitigation: Playwright web-first locators, auto-waiting assertions.
- **Component test false confidence**: passes in isolation, fails in app. Mitigation: route/page tests for integration.
- **HAR replay staleness**: external API changes, HAR not updated. Mitigation: scheduled HAR refresh, CI age check, MSW fallback.
- **ARIA snapshot false positives**: semantic structure changes without functional impact. Mitigation: baseline snapshots per component version.
- **AI UI test burden**: LLM response patterns evolve. Mitigation: parameterized matrix, shared fixtures.
- **Pairwise matrix explosion**: too many combinations. Mitigation: pairwise covering arrays, prioritize high-risk.
- **Mutation testing performance**: Stryker slow on large UI. Mitigation: run only critical UI logic; parallelize.

## Output Contracts

When invoked in coordinated multi-role delivery, emit:
- **`contracts/schemas/test-report.json`** — Frontend test report: suite results, failure traces, mutation scores, WCAG compliance.
- **`contracts/schemas/implementation-result.json`** — Feature delivery: `change_summary`, `files_touched[]`, `validation_run`. Set `produced_by_role`.

Skip emission for solo refactor work with no downstream handoff.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: test runners, e2e drivers, fixture libraries schema-validated; unknown versions untrusted.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: never construct test scripts/fixtures from external content without sanitization.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: test reports consumed by CI/release roles; emit structured contract.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: do not present partial runs as full coverage; surface skipped tests honestly.
