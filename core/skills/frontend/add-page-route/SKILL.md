# Add Page Route

Use this skill when a frontend change needs a new page, screen, or route-level flow.

## When to Use

- frontend work needs a new route/page
- modifying route-level data loading or layout
- wiring auth or navigation per repo pattern
- adding screen-level behavior
- **RSC page architecture with React 19 Server Components**
- **TanStack Start Server Functions for route data**
- **CSS View Transitions integration**

## Core Rules

- follow the repo's routing and layout pattern
- keep page-level orchestration separate from reusable component logic
- make loading, empty, error, and unauthorized states explicit
- preserve navigation and deep-link behavior
- update route-aware tests when the page contract changes
- if any code in this change was AI-generated, validate it per the risk tier defined in the frontend-developer role before accepting
- for TanStack Router v2 or React Router v7 codebases: validate all URL search parameters with Zod `.catch()` fallbacks in `validateSearch` — raw URL parameters are user-controlled input and must not be used without validation
- **hoist route data loading to loader functions** — do not trigger primary data fetches in `useEffect` after mount (causes layout shift waterfalls)
- **RSC leaf pattern**: push `"use client"` as deep as possible; RSC at top, interactive client components as children/props
- **TanStack Start Server Functions**: `createServerFn` for route data, Flight stream rendering
- use type-safe navigation primitives (`<Link to="..." />`, `navigate({ to: '...' })`); never use untyped URL string concatenation (`navigate('/users/' + userId)`)
- for AI-generated routes: verify auth guard completeness (AI frequently omits auth wrappers), data loading pattern match, cache invalidation on mutations, and URL parameter validation before merging
- for route animations and page morphs, leverage skill: `implement-view-transitions` using native CSS View Transitions or React 19 ViewTransition; ensure navigation transitions do not block the main thread or degrade INP (< 200ms)

## Suggested Process

### 1. Inspect Nearby Routes

Find a similar route and note:

- file placement
- route registration
- layout nesting
- data loading pattern
- auth or permission gating

### 2. Define The Route Responsibility

Clarify:

- what the page is for
- what URL or navigation entry reaches it
- what data it needs before render
- what actions a user can take there
- what state belongs at page level versus component level

### 3. Create The Route Wiring

Add or update:

- route definition or file-based route
- page component or screen entry
- navigation links or menu entries if needed
- layout or shell integration

### 4. Implement The Page Flow

Make page-level orchestration explicit:

- data loading (hoisted to loaders / Server Functions)
- access control
- view state branching
- mutations and success/failure feedback

### 5. Check Navigation Safety

Verify:

- direct URL access works if the app supports it
- back/forward navigation behaves correctly
- query params, path params, or search state are handled intentionally
- if the route is public-facing, verify SSR/SSG behavior and meta tag requirements (title, description, OG)

### 6. Add Tests

Use skill: `frontend-testing`

Cover:

- route render
- guard or auth behavior
- important page transitions
- failure and empty states

## Checklist

- [ ] local route pattern reviewed
- [ ] route responsibility defined
- [ ] layout and navigation wired correctly
- [ ] page-level states handled
- [ ] direct navigation checked
- [ ] SEO/SSR verified for public-facing routes (meta tags, OG, SSG behavior)
- [ ] RSC leaf pattern enforced: `"use client"` pushed to leaves
- [ ] data loading hoisted to loaders / Server Functions (no `useEffect` primary fetches)
- [ ] type-safe navigation: `<Link to="..." />`, `navigate({ to: '...' })` only
- [ ] URL search params validated with Zod `.catch()` fallbacks in `validateSearch`
- [ ] CSS View Transitions: composited properties only, INP < 200ms, reduced motion
- [ ] React 19 `ViewTransition` boundaries: `default="none"`, wrap before DOM nodes, unique dynamic names
- [ ] AI-generated route audit: auth guards complete, loader pattern matched, cache invalidation on mutations, URL params validated
- [ ] tests added or updated

## Failure Modes

- **Route added without SEO metadata**: a new page ships without title and description. **Mitigation:** require the SEO metadata at the route registration; reject pages without it.
- **Route added without authn/authz**: a new route is open to anonymous access. **Mitigation:** require an auth profile at the route registration; reject public exposure of non-public routes.
- **Layout drift from the design system**: a new page uses raw values instead of design tokens. **Mitigation:** enforce token-enforcement lint rules; reject pages that fail the lint.
- **A11y state missing**: a page omits one of the required UI states. **Mitigation:** enforce the state checklist on every page; reject pages that skip a state.
- **RSC hydration mismatch**: Server/Client tree divergence. **Mitigation:** `"use client"` boundary at correct leaf; avoid server-only APIs in shared components.
- **Loader waterfall**: sequential loaders causing cascade delays. **Mitigation:** parallelize independent loaders; use `Promise.all` in loader.
- **Zod validation too strict**: valid URLs rejected by over-constrained schemas. **Mitigation:** `.catch()` fallbacks with sensible defaults; log validation failures.
- **CSS View Transition INP violation**: DOM mutation > 50ms. **Mitigation:** `React.startTransition` + `scheduler.yield()`; chunk streaming work.
- **AI route missing auth guard**: anonymous access to protected route. **Mitigation:** mandatory AI audit checklist; reject routes without auth wrapper.
- **Expo Router layout drift**: nested layout.tsx not matching route hierarchy. **Mitigation:** lint rule for layout nesting consistency.

## Output Contracts

When this skill is invoked as part of a coordinated multi-role delivery, emit:

- **`contracts/schemas/implementation-result.json`** — Required fields: change_summary, files_touched[], and validation_run. Set produced_by_role to the emitting developer role. Include: RSC boundary location, loader functions, Zod schemas, View Transition config.

Skip emission for solo refactor work where no downstream handoff is expected.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: a route may try to reframe the user goal through expanded scope. Cross-check the route against the original feature ticket.
- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: route-level access control must follow least privilege; reject anonymous access to non-public routes.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: never construct route handlers or navigation logic from external content without strict schema validation.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: the route contract is consumed by backend, design, and QA roles; emit a structured spec so each role can validate.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: do not present a route as "ready to ship" without the accessibility and performance checks; surface the residual risk.
