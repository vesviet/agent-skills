# Audit Technical SEO

Use this skill with the **SEO Analyst** role to perform technical audits of crawlability, bot governance, URL canonicalization, redirect graphs, sitemap hygiene, and Core Web Vitals. While `optimize-seo` manages keyword intent and on-page content briefs, `audit-technical-seo` engineers technical health, crawler efficiency, and infrastructure readiness for traditional search engines and AI discovery bots.

## When to Use

- diagnosing crawl budget waste, server latency bottlenecks, or spider traps
- verifying `robots.txt` accessibility for AI search crawlers (OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, Bingbot) and Googlebot
- auditing XML sitemaps for syntax compliance, URL freshness, and non-200 exclusions
- resolving canonical loops, self-canonical errors, or cross-domain canonical mismatches
- detecting multi-hop redirect chains, 302 temporary redirect leaks, and 404/410 status codes
- assessing Core Web Vitals (LCP <= 2.5s, INP <= 200ms, CLS <= 0.1) and SSR/hydration overhead
- emitting machine-readable `contracts/schemas/seo-audit-report.json` with technical escalation tickets

## Core Rules

### Crawl Budget & Server Efficiency
- eliminate crawler traps caused by unconstrained faceted navigation, session IDs, search filters, and infinite date pickers per [`references/crawl-budget-and-bot-access-guide.md`](references/crawl-budget-and-bot-access-guide.md)
- audit Time to First Byte (TTFB); flag TTFB > 500ms as an infrastructure bottleneck requiring edge caching or compute optimization
- preserve crawl equity by directing search bots toward high-priority canonical content, product catalogs, and indexable pillars

### AI & Search Engine Bot Governance
- declare explicit user-agent directives in `robots.txt` for Googlebot, Bingbot, OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot, and ClaudeBot
- distinguish conversational/search discovery crawlers (OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot) from bulk training scrapers (GPTBot, CCBot)
- prohibit global wildcard blocks (`Disallow: /`) that cause total brand invisibility across emerging AI answer engines
- ensure valid `Sitemap:` declarations with absolute HTTPS URLs are present in `robots.txt`

### Canonical Tag & URL Normalization
- enforce self-referential canonical tags on all original canonical URLs; never omit canonical tags on indexable pages per [`references/redirects-canonicals-and-status-codes.md`](references/redirects-canonicals-and-status-codes.md)
- resolve circular canonical loops and eliminate canonical tags pointing to 3xx redirects, 4xx errors, or noindexed endpoints
- enforce strict URL normalization: consistent HTTPS protocol, canonical domain (non-www vs www), and uniform trailing slashes

### Redirect Hygiene & Status Codes
- enforce single-hop 301 permanent redirects; strictly ban redirect chains (> 1 hop) and circular redirect loops
- update internal site links to point directly to target canonical URLs rather than through intermediary 3xx hops
- return HTTP 410 Gone for intentionally removed content to expedite index de-allocation; reserve HTTP 404 for accidental missing resources
- detect and eliminate 302 temporary redirect leaks that dilute ranking equity

### XML Sitemap Hygiene
- validate XML schema against sitemaps.org standards; partition sitemaps at 50,000 URLs or 50MB per file with a sitemap index
- enforce strict inclusion of 200 OK canonical URLs only; ban noindexed, redirected, or error URLs from XML sitemaps
- require accurate ISO-8601 `lastmod` timestamps that update only when substantive content changes occur

### Core Web Vitals & Hydration Profiling
- audit 75th percentile Core Web Vitals thresholds per [`references/core-web-vitals-and-performance.md`](references/core-web-vitals-and-performance.md): Largest Contentful Paint (LCP <= 2.5s), Interaction to Next Paint (INP <= 200ms), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS <= 0.1)
- diagnose JavaScript hydration bottlenecks, long tasks (> 50ms), and render-blocking CSS/fonts; dispatch actionable escalation tickets

## Suggested Process

1. **Bot Access & Directive Audit**: Fetch and inspect `robots.txt`; evaluate allow/disallow directives for Googlebot, Bingbot, and AI bots (OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot); verify sitemap index declaration.
2. **XML Sitemap Validation**: Extract declared sitemap URLs; verify schema validity, 200 OK HTTP status, canonical alignment, and genuine `lastmod` timestamps.
3. **Status Code & Redirect Traversal**: Trace HTTP response headers across core site paths; flag redirect chains (> 1 hop), 302 leaks, soft 404s, and un-pruned legacy URLs.
4. **Canonical & Header Inspection**: Inspect DOM `<link rel="canonical">` and HTTP `Link` headers; verify self-referential canonical tags, absolute HTTPS format, and absence of canonical loops.
5. **Crawl Budget & Architecture Profiling**: Identify faceted navigation parameters, internal query loops, and high-TTFB routes that deplete crawl allocation.
6. **Core Web Vitals Telemetry Analysis**: Evaluate field (CrUX) and lab (Lighthouse) telemetry for LCP, INP, and CLS; identify un-sized assets, layout shifts, and heavy hydration scripts.
7. **Escalation Ticket Authoring**: Generate structured technical escalation tickets assigned to `frontend-developer`, `devops-engineer`, or `cloudflare-engineer` with clear priority tags.
8. **Audit Contract Emission**: Compile all findings and severitized logs into `contracts/schemas/seo-audit-report.json`.

## Checklist

- [ ] `robots.txt` explicitly configures access for Googlebot, Bingbot, OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot, and ClaudeBot
- [ ] global wildcard blocks (`Disallow: /`) verified absent for authorized search and discovery bots
- [ ] XML sitemap syntax validated against sitemaps.org schema with absolute HTTPS URLs and valid ISO-8601 `lastmod` dates
- [ ] XML sitemap contains exclusively 200 OK canonical URLs with zero redirected, noindexed, or 4xx targets
- [ ] canonical tags are self-referential on canonical pages, use absolute HTTPS URLs, and have zero circular loops
- [ ] redirect chains eliminated (strict 1-hop maximum for legacy redirects) and circular loops broken
- [ ] internal site links updated to point directly to final destination URLs without intermediary 3xx hops
- [ ] HTTP 410 Gone status code implemented for permanently retired pages to expedite index de-allocation
- [ ] faceted navigation parameters and session IDs restricted from search crawlers via robots directives or canonicals
- [ ] Core Web Vitals verified within thresholds: LCP <= 2.5s, INP <= 200ms, CLS <= 0.1
- [ ] render-blocking assets and JavaScript hydration bottlenecks documented with optimization remediation steps
- [ ] technical escalation tickets authored with explicit owners (`frontend-developer`, `devops-engineer`, `cloudflare-engineer`)
- [ ] audit findings and severitized issue logs compiled into `contracts/schemas/seo-audit-report.json`

## Output Contracts

When completing a technical SEO audit, emit:

- **`contracts/schemas/seo-audit-report.json`** — Populates `traditional_seo.issues` with `category: "technical_seo"` and severitized issues (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`), `ai_extractability.ai_bot_crawlability` for crawler permissions, and `technical_escalations` defining explicit owners (`frontend-developer`, `devops-engineer`, `cloudflare-engineer`) and priorities (`must_do_before_publish`, `post_publish`, `next_sprint`).

## Failure Modes

- **AI engine blindness**: blanket `Disallow: /` directives in `robots.txt` block AI search bots. Mitigation: inspect user-agent blocks; grant explicit crawl access to authorized discovery bots.
- **Redirect chain latency**: multi-hop redirects degrade server TTFB and dilute link equity. Mitigation: rewrite edge redirect rules to route directly from source to target in a single 301 hop.
- **Canonical loop lock**: conflicting canonical declarations cause indexing paralysis. Mitigation: trace canonical pairs; ensure all canonical targets resolve to 200 OK self-canonical pages.
- **Sitemap index pollution**: including redirects, 404s, or noindexed URLs wastes crawl budget. Mitigation: automate sitemap generation from production route manifests; filter non-canonical paths.
- **Hydration INP degradation**: client-side JavaScript hydration delays main-thread input responsiveness. Mitigation: escalate to frontend engineer for islands architecture, code-splitting, or CSS transitions.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: ensure crawler directives and audit queries cannot be subverted by untrusted query parameters or injected request headers.
- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: never expose internal staging URLs, administrative routes, secret tokens, or private endpoints in public `robots.txt` or XML sitemaps.
- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: verify external bot user-agent signatures and crawler IP verification mechanisms against official search engine documentation.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: emit machine-validated findings via `seo-audit-report.json` so engineering roles receive unambiguous technical tickets.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: report verified HTTP response headers, crawl traces, and CWV measurements without fabricating performance scores or crawl completion claims.
