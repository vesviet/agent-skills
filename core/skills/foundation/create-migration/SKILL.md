# Create Migration

Use this skill when the user needs to add or review a database schema migration, backfill, or data repair step.

## Core Rules

- follow the repo's existing migration tool, naming, and ordering conventions
- prefer rollout-safe additive changes before destructive changes — renaming or dropping a column/table in a single release is strictly prohibited
- use the Expand-Contract (Parallel Change) pattern for destructive changes: Phase 1 (Expand: add new structure), Phase 2 (Backfill: dual-write / CDC), Phase 3 (Contract: remove old structure after full cutover)
- every DDL migration must set `SET lock_timeout = '2s';` to prevent queuing locks behind long-running queries from taking down connection pools
- build indexes with `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (PostgreSQL) or online DDL tools (`gh-ost` for MySQL) to avoid `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` table locks on large tables
- backfill historical data in small batches (500–2000 rows) with sleep intervals to keep replication lag and I/O load near zero
- use feature flags for dual-read / shadow-read validation and instant rollback — percentage-based traffic cutover 1% → 10% → 50% → 100%
- keep schema changes, backfills, and cleanup in separate releases when that reduces risk
- make rollback behavior explicit when the repo supports rollback — document when reversal is partial or unsafe
- verify code and schema compatibility across staged deployment; database migrations must be deployable before application code releases

## When to Use

- adding or changing tables, collections, or indexes
- adding, removing, or renaming fields or columns
- introducing constraints or defaults
- performing data backfills or cleanup
- preparing persistence changes for a feature rollout

## Operating Assumptions

This skill is intentionally repo-agnostic.

- do not assume a specific migration tool
- do not assume a specific database engine
- do not assume SQL files are the only migration format
- prefer the repo's existing naming, ordering, and rollback conventions

## First Questions To Answer

Before writing the migration, confirm:

1. What persistence system is being changed?
2. What tool or format does this repo use for migrations?
3. Is the change schema-only, data-only, or both?
4. Can the change be rolled out safely while old and new code coexist?
5. What is the rollback path if deployment must be reversed?

## Suggested Process

The full 7-step workflow lives in
[`references/suggested-process.md`](references/suggested-process.md). Key
constraints the main file keeps in scope:

- Follow the repo's existing migration tool, naming, and ordering conventions.
- Always set `SET lock_timeout = '2s';` on DDL migrations.
- Always use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (PostgreSQL) or `gh-ost` (MySQL) for large tables.
- Backfill in batches of 500-2000 rows with sleep intervals; monitor replication lag.
- Use feature flags for dual-read / shadow-read validation and instant rollback.
- Keep schema changes, backfills, and cleanup in separate releases when that reduces risk.




## Safety Guidelines

- prefer additive changes over destructive changes
- separate schema change from backfill when that reduces risk
- index columns that will be heavily queried after rollout
- avoid full-table rewrites in peak-risk paths when safer alternatives exist
- document assumptions for large datasets or long-running operations

For the full pattern library (additive schema change, expand-and-contract,
data backfill) and the common gotchas, see
[`references/patterns-and-gotchas.md`](references/patterns-and-gotchas.md).

## What To Capture In Your Output

When reporting migration work, include:

- what changed
- why the change is needed
- rollout safety notes
- rollback notes
- any required follow-up in code or deployment order

## Checklist

- [ ] existing migration pattern inspected
- [ ] current schema or data state understood
- [ ] rollout safety considered
- [ ] forward migration written
- [ ] rollback path written or explicitly limited
- [ ] dependent code updated
- [ ] migration verified with repo-local commands
- [ ] release ordering or backfill notes captured
- [ ] for destructive changes, Expand-Contract pattern documented with phases
- [ ] for PostgreSQL, `SET lock_timeout = '2s';` set on every DDL migration
- [ ] for large tables, index built with `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (PG) or `gh-ost` (MySQL)
- [ ] backfill is batched (500-2000 rows) and restartable; replication lag and I/O load monitored
- [ ] data-classification.yaml applied to any column that stores PII or restricted data

## Quick Reference

Use this for rapid migration creation:

- inspect existing migrations
- match naming and ordering
- design the safest rollout shape
- write forward and rollback steps
- update dependent code
- verify locally

## Related Skills

- **commit-code**: Prepare migration changes for delivery
- **review-code**: Review safety, compatibility, and rollback risk
- **write-tests**: Add regression coverage for schema-sensitive behavior
- **review-service**: Validate release readiness for persistence changes

## Output Contracts

- `contracts/schemas/schema-migration.json`

When the migration is consumed by a release manager, an infra agent, or a
downstream reviewer, emit the JSON contract alongside the migration file.
The JSON must name the migration's forward and rollback behavior, the
rollout phases (Expand-Contract when applicable), the batch size for any
backfill, and the data classification of any new column.

## Failure Modes

- **Single-release destructive change**: a column is renamed or dropped in a single release. Mitigation: enforce the Expand-Contract pattern; reject migrations that combine remove-old and add-new without a dual-write phase.
- **Lock pool starvation**: a long-running DDL blocks the connection pool. Mitigation: set `SET lock_timeout = '2s';` on every DDL migration; surface timeout as a CI failure.
- **ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on a large table**: a `CREATE INDEX` locks the table for writes. Mitigation: use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (PostgreSQL) or `gh-ost` (MySQL) for large tables.
- **Unbatched backfill**: a backfill rewrites millions of rows in a single statement. Mitigation: batch in 500-2000 row chunks with sleep intervals; monitor replication lag and I/O load.
- **Rollback over-promised**: the rollback path is declared "safe" but the destructive change is not reversible. Mitigation: document the rollback as "partial" or "unsafe" when the data has already changed; never claim a destructive data change is fully reversible.
- **PII column added without classification**: a new column stores customer PII but is not classified. Mitigation: classify every new column with `data-classification.yaml`; surface restricted columns in the migration report.
- **Permanent flag without cleanup**: a feature flag is introduced to gate the migration but has no cleanup target. Mitigation: every flag must carry an ISO 8601 cleanup target.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: the migration's privileged database role must be scoped to the minimum required grants; reject migrations that run under a superuser role when a scoped role would suffice.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: never construct migration SQL from external or user-supplied content; treat the migration file as the source of truth and lint it against expected patterns.
- **ASI06 Memory & Context Poisoning**: when the migration is informed by retrieved memory (e.g., a prior migration's notes), validate every note against the live schema before relying on it.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: the migration is consumed by release and infra agents; emit a structured `schema-migration.json` so each consumer can validate the rollout plan.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: do not declare a destructive migration "safe" without naming the residual risk; surface partial-rollback or unsafe-rollback honestly.
