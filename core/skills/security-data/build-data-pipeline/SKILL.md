# Build Data Pipeline

Use this skill when building or maintaining transactional lakehouse infrastructure: ingestion pipelines, table formats, schema contracts, Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) validation, dead-letter quarantine (DLQ), and orchestration. For one-off exploratory queries, use `analyze-data` instead.

## When to Use

- implementing transactional lakehouse pipelines with Apache Iceberg v3 or Delta Lake 4.0 UniForm
- enforcing Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS v3.1.0) at producer boundaries before ingestion
- staging writes to isolated snapshot branches (`wap_audit_<run_id>`) for atomic Write-Audit-Publish (WAP)
- auditing branch data in-process via DuckDB zero-copy Arrow memory before publishing to `main`
- routing poisoned or non-conforming records into Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) quarantine with circuit breaker
- enforcing deterministic upsert `MERGE INTO` with composite SHA-256 cryptographic natural keys
- configuring S3 object storage prefix hashing (`write.object-storage.enabled = true`) to prevent 503 throttling
- executing automated table maintenance: 256MB bin-pack compaction, 7-day snapshot expiration, 72h vacuum

## Core Rules

- **Read-Only Sources**: treat all source inputs as read-only; never mutate upstream source files or CDC logs.
- **ODCS v3.1.0 Contract Verification**: validate raw payloads against version-controlled ODCS v3.1.0 schemas at producer boundaries before ingestion; reject uncontracted schema drift.
- **Modern Lakehouse Table Formats**:
  - standardize on **Apache Iceberg v3** with Puffin RoaringBitmap Deletion Vectors (DVs) and integer `spec-id` partition evolution; avoid legacy position deletes.
  - support **Delta Lake 4.0 UniForm** for universal Iceberg metadata compatibility and Liquid Clustering.
  - coordinate catalog metadata through REST Catalogs (Polaris, Unity Catalog OSS) with short-lived STS tokens.
- **S3 Object Storage Prefix Hashing**: set table property `write.object-storage.enabled = true` on high-throughput Iceberg tables to distribute Parquet files across hashed S3 prefixes, preventing AWS S3 503 Slow Down errors.
- **Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) Protocol**:
  1. *Write*: validate contracts and quarantine non-compliant records to DLQ; stage only compliant, deduplicated Parquet batches to an isolated Iceberg snapshot branch (`wap_audit_<run_id>`).
  2. *Audit*: execute automated contract assertions in-process via DuckDB over zero-copy Apache Arrow memory (`SET max_memory = '4GB';`). If circuit breaker $Q_r > 2.0\%$ ($N \ge 50$) trips or audits fail, abort without publishing.
  3. *Publish*: atomically fast-forward the `main` branch pointer to the audited snapshot; prune temporary branches.
- **DLQ Envelopes & Mathematical Circuit Breaker**:
  - quarantine non-conforming rows into a structured DLQ table with diagnostic JSON envelopes (`quarantine_id`, `source_system`, `batch_id`, `trace_id`, `payload_raw`, `error_code`, `violated_rule`, `diagnostic_context`).
  - calculate quarantine ratio: $Q_r = (N_{\text{quarantined}} / N_{\text{total}}) \times 100%$.
  - trip circuit breaker and halt pipeline if $Q_r > 2.0%$ with minimum sample size floor $N \ge 50$.
- **Deterministic Upsert MERGE**:
  - generate composite SHA-256 cryptographic natural keys: `SHA256(col1 || '|' || col2 || '|' || col3)`.
  - apply intra-batch window deduplication (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY natural_key ORDER BY event_ts DESC) = 1`).
  - execute atomic `MERGE INTO` with watermark check (`source.event_ts >= target.event_ts`); never use non-idempotent appends.
- **Lakehouse Maintenance Lifecycle**:
  - bin-pack compaction (`rewrite_data_files`) merging Deletion Vectors to target 256MB Parquet blocks.
  - manifest rewriting (`rewrite_manifests`), 7-day TTL snapshot expiration with 50-snapshot floor, 72-hour orphan vacuuming.
- **Zero-Trust & PII Governance**: mask or hash PII per `data-classification.yaml`; enforce Column-Level Security (CLS) and Row-Level Security (RLS); sanitize RAG vector inputs per OWASP ASI06.
- detailed specifications are maintained in [`references/producer-contracts-and-lakehouse.md`](references/producer-contracts-and-lakehouse.md) and [`references/quality-gates-dlq-and-replayability.md`](references/quality-gates-dlq-and-replayability.md).

## Suggested Process

### 1. Ingest & Verify Producer Contract
Validate incoming batch or streaming event schemas against the ODCS v3.1.0 contract in producer CI/CD before persisting to storage.

### 2. Contract Validation, DLQ Quarantine & WAP Branch Staging
Validate incoming batch records against the ODCS contract. Route non-compliant records to the DLQ with structured envelopes. Calculate quarantine ratio $Q_r = (N_{\text{quarantined}} / N_{\text{total}}) \times 100\%$. Write and stage only compliant, deduplicated records to an isolated Iceberg snapshot branch (`wap_audit_<run_id>`) with `write.object-storage.enabled = true`.

### 3. Zero-Copy In-Process Arrow Audit
Run in-process DuckDB zero-copy Arrow memory audits (`SET max_memory = '4GB';`) against the staged data on the isolated branch. Execute assertion queries checking nullability, value ranges, distribution drift, and foreign keys.

### 4. Circuit Breaker & Audit Verification Gate
Evaluate audit query results and quarantine rate. If circuit breaker $Q_r > 2.0\%$ ($N \ge 50$) tripped, or if any DuckDB audit query fails, abort the transaction without publishing, drop the temporary audit branch, and alert.

### 5. Atomic Upsert MERGE & Fast-Forward Publish
Execute atomic `MERGE INTO` using composite SHA-256 natural keys. Fast-forward the `main` branch pointer to the validated branch snapshot knowing that uncontracted and defective data was already isolated in DLQ, then prune temporary audit branch metadata.

### 6. Emit Pipeline Spec & FinOps Tags
Validate outputs against `contracts/schemas/data-pipeline-spec.json`. Tag maintenance metadata with `CostCenter`, `Environment`, and `TableOwner`.

## Output Contracts

When emitting pipeline specifications for downstream consumers, orchestrators, or cross-role handoffs, emit:

- `contracts/schemas/data-pipeline-spec.json` — complete pipeline definition, ODCS contract version, table format properties, WAP configuration, circuit breaker thresholds, and FinOps metadata.
- `contracts/schemas/data-analysis-report.json` — summary of ingested row counts, validation metrics, and data quality results when cross-role handoff to Data Analyst is required.

## Failure Modes

- **Silent schema poisoning**: unannounced upstream schema changes corrupt lakehouse tables. Mitigation: enforce ODCS v3.1.0 pre-ingestion validation; route non-conforming payloads to DLQ quarantine.
- **S3 partition throttling storm**: high-volume writes hit single S3 prefix limits causing 503 Slow Down errors. Mitigation: set table property `write.object-storage.enabled = true` for prefix hashing.
- **Direct write corruption**: unvalidated rows written directly to `main`. Mitigation: mandate Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) isolated snapshot branches (`wap_audit_<run_id>`).
- **DLQ poison overflow**: high-volume bad data floods quarantine silently. Mitigation: enforce circuit breaker halting ingestion when $Q_r > 2.0%$ ($N \ge 50$).
- **Non-idempotent replay duplication**: retrying a pipeline run creates duplicate records. Mitigation: require idempotent `MERGE INTO` operations on composite SHA-256 natural keys.

- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: validate connectors, dbt packages, and Iceberg catalog drivers against approved manifests.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: parameterize all dynamic SQL and partition paths; prohibit raw string interpolation.
- **ASI06 Context & Memory Poisoning**: sanitize and provenance-tag document chunks before RAG vector ingestion.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: emit structured `data-pipeline-spec.json` contracts for downstream agents.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: disclose residual ingestion risks, SLA deviations, and quality validation metrics truthfully.
