# Build Data Pipeline

Use this skill when building or maintaining transactional lakehouse infrastructure: ingestion pipelines, table formats, schema contracts, Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) validation, dead-letter quarantine (DLQ), and orchestration. For one-off exploratory queries, use `analyze-data` instead.

## When to Use

- implementing transactional lakehouse pipelines with Apache Iceberg v4 (metadata-only restructuring), Iceberg v3, or Delta Lake 4.0 UniForm
- enforcing Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS v3.1.0) at producer boundaries before ingestion
- staging writes to isolated snapshot branches (`wap_audit_<run_id>`) for atomic Write-Audit-Publish (WAP)
- auditing branch data in-process via DuckDB zero-copy Arrow memory before publishing to `main`
- routing poisoned or non-conforming records into Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) quarantine with circuit breaker **wired to contract SLA fields**
- enforcing deterministic upsert `MERGE INTO` with composite SHA-256 cryptographic natural keys
- configuring S3 object storage prefix hashing (`write.object-storage.enabled = true`) to prevent 503 throttling
- executing automated table maintenance: 256MB bin-pack compaction, 7-day snapshot expiration, 72h vacuum
- implementing Iceberg REST Catalog protocol: scan planning, ETag-based freshness validation, Idempotency-Key commits, credential vending
- mandating native table encryption (KMS) for all Iceberg and Delta Lake tables
- emitting OpenLineage explicit lineage facets for end-to-end pipeline traceability

## Core Rules

- **Read-Only Sources**: treat all source inputs as read-only; never mutate upstream source files or CDC logs.
- **ODCS v3.1.0 Contract Verification**: validate raw payloads against version-controlled ODCS v3.1.0 schemas at producer boundaries before ingestion; reject uncontracted schema drift.
- **Modern Lakehouse Table Formats**:
  - standardize on **Apache Iceberg v4** with metadata-only restructuring (never data rewrites for schema/partition evolution) and **Iceberg v3** with Puffin RoaringBitmap Deletion Vectors (DVs) and integer `spec-id` partition evolution; avoid legacy position deletes.
  - support **Delta Lake 4.0 UniForm** for universal Iceberg metadata compatibility and Liquid Clustering.
  - **Variant as Canonical Semi-Structured Path**: adopt `VARIANT` type for schemaless JSON payloads, eliminating `string` blob anti-patterns and enabling pushdown predicate evaluation on nested fields.
  - coordinate catalog metadata through REST Catalogs (Polaris, Unity Catalog OSS, Lakekeeper) with short-lived STS tokens.
- **Iceberg REST Catalog Protocol**: implement scan planning (`POST /v1/oauth/tokens`, `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/tables`), ETag-based freshness validation (`If-None-Match`), Idempotency-Key commits for exactly-once writes, and dynamic credential vending (`GET /v1/credentials`).
- **S3 Object Storage Prefix Hashing**: set table property `write.object-storage.enabled = true` on high-throughput Iceberg tables to distribute Parquet files across hashed S3 prefixes, preventing AWS S3 503 Slow Down errors.
- **Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) Protocol**:
  1. *Write*: validate contracts and quarantine non-compliant records to DLQ; stage only compliant, deduplicated Parquet batches to an isolated Iceberg snapshot branch (`wap_audit_<run_id>`).
  2. *Audit*: execute automated contract assertions in-process via DuckDB over zero-copy Apache Arrow memory (`SET max_memory = '4GB';`). If circuit breaker $Q_r > 2.0\%$ ($N \ge 50$) trips or audits fail, abort without publishing.
  3. *Publish*: atomically fast-forward the `main` branch pointer to the audited snapshot; prune temporary branches.
- **DLQ Envelopes & Mathematical Circuit Breaker**:
  - quarantine non-conforming rows into a structured DLQ table with diagnostic JSON envelopes (`quarantine_id`, `source_system`, `batch_id`, `trace_id`, `payload_raw`, `error_code`, `violated_rule`, `diagnostic_context`).
  - calculate quarantine ratio: $Q_r = (N_{\text{quarantined}} / N_{\text{total}}) \times 100%$.
  - trip circuit breaker and halt pipeline if $Q_r > 2.0%$ with minimum sample size floor $N \ge 50$.
  - **wire DLQ to contract SLA fields**: map DLQ metrics to ODCS freshness and quality SLA thresholds for automated alerting.
- **Deterministic Upsert MERGE**:
  - generate composite SHA-256 cryptographic natural keys: `SHA256(col1 || '|' || col2 || '|' || col3)`.
  - apply intra-batch window deduplication (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY natural_key ORDER BY event_ts DESC) = 1`).
  - execute atomic `MERGE INTO` with watermark check (`source.event_ts >= target.event_ts`); never use non-idempotent appends.
- **Lakehouse Maintenance Lifecycle**:
  - bin-pack compaction (`rewrite_data_files`) merging Deletion Vectors to target 256MB Parquet blocks.
  - manifest rewriting (`rewrite_manifests`), 7-day TTL snapshot expiration with 50-snapshot floor, 72-hour orphan vacuuming.
- **Native Table Encryption (KMS)**: mandate AES-256 encryption at rest via cloud KMS (AWS KMS, GCP CMEK, Azure Key Vault) for all Iceberg and Delta Lake tables; manage encryption keys through catalog-integrated key management.
- **OpenLineage Explicit Lineage**: emit column-level lineage events for all pipeline stages (extraction, transformation, load) to enable end-to-end traceability and impact analysis.
- **Zero-Trust & PII Governance**: mask or hash PII per `data-classification.yaml`; enforce Column-Level Security (CLS) and Row-Level Security (RLS); sanitize RAG vector inputs per OWASP ASI06.
- detailed specifications are maintained in [`references/producer-contracts-and-lakehouse.md`](references/producer-contracts-and-lakehouse.md) and [`references/quality-gates-dlq-and-replayability.md`](references/quality-gates-dlq-and-replayability.md).

## Suggested Process

### 1. Ingest & Verify Producer Contract
Validate incoming batch or streaming event schemas against the ODCS v3.1.0 contract in producer CI/CD before persisting to storage.

### 2. Contract Validation, DLQ Quarantine & WAP Branch Staging
Validate incoming batch records against the ODCS contract. Route non-compliant records to the DLQ with structured envelopes. Calculate quarantine ratio $Q_r = (N_{\text{quarantined}} / N_{\text{total}}) \times 100\%$. Write and stage only compliant, deduplicated records to an isolated Iceberg snapshot branch (`wap_audit_<run_id>`) with `write.object-storage.enabled = true`.

### 3. Zero-Copy In-Process Arrow Audit
Run in-process DuckDB zero-copy Arrow memory audits (`SET max_memory = '4GB';`) against the staged data on the isolated branch. Execute assertion queries checking nullability, value ranges, distribution drift, and foreign keys.

### 4. Circuit Breaker & Audit Verification Gate
Evaluate audit query results and quarantine rate. If circuit breaker $Q_r > 2.0\%$ ($N \ge 50$) tripped, or if any DuckDB audit query fails, abort the transaction without publishing, drop the temporary audit branch, and alert.

### 5. Atomic Upsert MERGE & Fast-Forward Publish
Execute atomic `MERGE INTO` using composite SHA-256 natural keys. Fast-forward the `main` branch pointer to the validated branch snapshot knowing that uncontracted and defective data was already isolated in DLQ, then prune temporary audit branch metadata.

### 6. Iceberg REST Catalog Operations
Execute scan planning via REST API, validate ETag freshness, commit with Idempotency-Key for exactly-once semantics, and fetch short-lived credentials from catalog credential vending endpoint.

### 7. Native Encryption & OpenLineage Emission
Apply KMS-managed AES-256 encryption at rest. Emit OpenLineage column-level lineage events for extraction, transformation, and load stages.

### 8. Emit Pipeline Spec & FinOps Tags
Validate outputs against `contracts/schemas/data-pipeline-spec.json`. Tag maintenance metadata with `CostCenter`, `Environment`, and `TableOwner`.

## Output Contracts

When emitting pipeline specifications for downstream consumers, orchestrators, or cross-role handoffs, emit:

- `contracts/schemas/data-pipeline-spec.json` — complete pipeline definition, ODCS contract version, table format properties, WAP configuration, circuit breaker thresholds, FinOps metadata, **Iceberg REST protocol config, KMS encryption config, OpenLineage facets**.
- `contracts/schemas/data-analysis-report.json` — summary of ingested row counts, validation metrics, and data quality results when cross-role handoff to Data Analyst is required.

## Failure Modes

- **Silent schema poisoning**: unannounced upstream schema changes corrupt lakehouse tables. Mitigation: enforce ODCS v3.1.0 pre-ingestion validation; route non-conforming payloads to DLQ quarantine.
- **S3 partition throttling storm**: high-volume writes hit single S3 prefix limits causing 503 Slow Down errors. Mitigation: set table property `write.object-storage.enabled = true` for prefix hashing.
- **Direct write corruption**: unvalidated rows written directly to `main`. Mitigation: mandate Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) isolated snapshot branches (`wap_audit_<run_id>`).
- **DLQ poison overflow**: high-volume bad data floods quarantine silently. Mitigation: enforce circuit breaker halting ingestion when $Q_r > 2.0%$ ($N \ge 50$).
- **Non-idempotent replay duplication**: retrying a pipeline run creates duplicate records. Mitigation: require idempotent `MERGE INTO` operations on composite SHA-256 natural keys.
- **Unencrypted data at rest**: lakehouse tables lack native AES-256 encryption via KMS. Mitigation: enforce native table encryption (KMS) for all Iceberg and Delta Lake tables.
- **Missing lineage traceability**: pipeline stages do not emit OpenLineage events, breaking impact analysis. Mitigation: enforce OpenLineage explicit lineage emission for all stages.
- **Iceberg REST protocol bypass**: direct catalog access bypassing REST API scan planning, ETag, Idempotency-Key, and credential vending. Mitigation: enforce REST Catalog protocol for all catalog operations.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: classify PII with `data-classification.yaml`; enforce short-lived STS tokens via REST Catalog.
- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: validate connectors, dbt packages, and Iceberg catalog drivers against approved manifests.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: parameterize all dynamic SQL and partition paths; prohibit raw string interpolation.
- **ASI06 Context & Memory Poisoning**: sanitize and provenance-tag document chunks before RAG vector ingestion.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: emit structured `data-pipeline-spec.json` contracts for downstream agents.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: disclose residual ingestion risks, SLA deviations, and quality validation metrics truthfully.
- **NATIVE-ENCRYPTION-LOCK**: all Iceberg and Delta Lake tables must enforce AES-256 encryption at rest via cloud KMS; encryption keys managed through catalog-integrated key management.
- **OPENLINEAGE-LOCK**: all pipeline stages must emit column-level OpenLineage events for end-to-end traceability and impact analysis.
- **ICEBERG-REST-PROTOCOL-LOCK**: REST Catalog operations must use Iceberg REST protocol (scan planning, ETag freshness validation, Idempotency-Key commits, credential vending); direct catalog access bypassing REST is prohibited.
