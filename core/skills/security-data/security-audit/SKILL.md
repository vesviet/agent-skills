# Security Audit

Use this skill when reviewing a change, service, or deployment for security posture and obvious risk.

## When to Use

- focused security review of a change
- full-service risk assessment
- checking trust boundaries, secrets, auth, validation
- AI/ML review via OWASP ASI + NIST + ISO 42001

## Core Rules

- focus on real trust boundaries and attack surfaces
- prioritize exploitable risk over checklist theater
- treat code, config, and runtime exposure together
- call out unclear assumptions as risk, not as proof of safety
- avoid exposing real secrets or exploit details unnecessarily in user-visible artifacts
- **CVSS 4.0 & EPSS Triage**: Score vulnerabilities using CVSS 4.0 with CVSS-BTE nomenclature distinguishing Vulnerable System (VC/VI/VA) from Subsequent Systems (SC/SI/SA); MSS (Supplemental) metrics include Automatable and Recovery. Prioritize via the `CVSS 4.0 × EPSS × CISA KEV` triad (EPSS > 10% or CISA KEV requires 24–48h fix).
- **CVE Reachability Analysis**: Distinguish reachable from unreachable transitive CVEs via AST call-graph tracing (`govulncheck`, `osv-scanner`, `npm audit`); emit VEX `not_affected` (code_not_reachable) instead of blocking releases on dead code paths.
- **OWASP Top 10:2025 A10**: A10:2025 is "Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions" — audit error-handling paths and exception blocks; ensure fail-closed behavior (deny by default on uncaught exceptions, release DB connections, no stack trace leakage).
- **OWASP ASI01–10 (official 2026 list)**: for agentic AI systems apply the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026 exactly as published — ASI01 Agent Goal Hijack, ASI02 Tool Misuse & Exploitation, ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse, ASI04 Agentic Supply Chain, ASI05 Unexpected Code Execution (verify sandbox boundary adherence against `core/policies/execution-sandbox.md`), ASI06 Memory & Context Poisoning, ASI07 Insecure Inter-Agent Communication, ASI08 Cascading Failures, ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation, ASI10 Rogue Agents.
- **ZTA-MTLS**: Zero Trust Architecture deployments MUST enforce mTLS between all internal services using SPIFFE/SPIRE for workload identity issuance; block any service-to-service communication without a valid SVID.
- **EU-CRA-REPORTING**: EU Cyber Resilience Act reporting obligations have applied since 2026-09-11 — actively exploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents must reach ENISA/CSIRT within 24 hours; main product obligations (security-by-design, ≥5-year support period) land 2026-12-11 and machine-readable SBOM obligations by 2027-12-11. Flag any product in EU scope without a live, tested reporting runbook as a compliance finding.
- **PQC-TRANSITION**: audit cryptography against NIST IR 8547 (quantum-vulnerable RSA/ECDSA/ECDH/DH deprecated after 2030, disallowed after 2035): verify a CBOM crypto inventory (CycloneDX 1.6) exists and hybrid TLS (X25519MLKEM768 — client-side default since Chrome 131/Firefox 132) is enabled where TLS terminates server-side.
- **GenAI Red Teaming Manual**: structure adversarial testing of AI systems per OWASP GenAI Red Teaming Manual v1.0 (2026-10-20); record test coverage in the audit findings.

## Suggested Process

### 1. Identify The Security Boundary

Clarify:

- what data is sensitive
- who the actors are
- what external inputs are accepted
- what systems or credentials are trusted

### 2. Review The Main Risk Areas

Check:

- authn and authz
- input validation and output exposure
- secret and credential handling
- logging of sensitive data
- dependency and downstream trust assumptions
- unsafe default configuration or missing environment hardening

### 3. Check Change-Specific Risk

For a concrete change, verify:

- new endpoints or routes are protected appropriately
- new background or event paths do not bypass controls
- new config does not widen exposure unintentionally
- new dependencies are bounded and authenticated as expected

### 4. Check Operational Exposure

Review:

- debug or admin surfaces
- runtime permissions
- public network reachability
- auditability and rollback assumptions

### 5. Report Findings By Severity

Use:

- blocking risk for clear security flaws
- high-severity risk for likely misuse or privilege widening
- follow-up risk for hardening gaps that should be tracked

### 6. CVE Remediation & Virtual Patching

When an active CVE is identified:
- verify AST call-graph reachability before filing release-blocking issues
- apply SemVer-safe in-place upgrades; if breaking or unpatched, author virtual patch middleware (input validation/sanitization)
- run table-driven regression tests to verify exploit payload rejection

## Checklist

- [ ] trust boundary identified
- [ ] sensitive data paths reviewed
- [ ] auth and validation checked
- [ ] secret handling checked
- [ ] runtime exposure checked
- [ ] findings reported with clear severity using CVSS 4.0 BTE nomenclature
- [ ] OWASP Top 10:2025 gaps reviewed (A03 Supply Chain, A10 Exceptional Conditions, Misconfiguration)
- [ ] OWASP ASI01–10 checks applied for agentic AI systems (ASI05 execution sandbox verified per `core/policies/execution-sandbox.md`)
- [ ] ZTA mTLS / SPIFFE/SPIRE verification for zero-trust deployments
- [ ] SLSA Level 3 supply chain integrity checked for production builds
- [ ] EU CRA readiness checked for products in EU scope: 24h reporting runbook live (since 2026-09-11), support period declared, SBOM pipeline building toward the 2027-12-11 gate
- [ ] PQC readiness checked: CBOM crypto inventory present, hybrid TLS (X25519MLKEM768) enabled server-side, no quantum-vulnerable-only crypto for long-lived data

## Failure Modes

- **Audit scope too narrow**: the audit covers only one layer (e.g., code) and misses infra or identity. Mitigation: enumerate the full trust boundary before scoping.
- **Finding hidden in summary**: a high-severity finding is buried in the audit report. Mitigation: lead with severity-sorted findings; never present severity-3+ as appendix items.
- **No repro path**: a finding has no reproducible evidence. Mitigation: every finding must include a path, a command, and the expected vs actual output.
- **Remediation not validated**: a finding is closed without re-running the scan or test. Mitigation: re-run the audit after every remediation; record the before/after.
- **OWASP ASI not applied**: a finding is reported without referencing the OWASP ASI item. Mitigation: tag every finding with the relevant ASI01-ASI10 item and the agentic threat surface.
- **Credential in finding**: a finding includes a real secret or token. Mitigation: redact before publishing; never paste live credentials into audit reports.
- **Invented ASI titles**: findings tagged against non-existent ASI items (e.g. "ASI08 Missing HITL", "ASI02 Excessive Agency"). Mitigation: tag only against the official ASI01–ASI10 titles in Core Rules; treat any other label as an audit-quality defect.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: when auditing agentic systems, verify that untrusted content (tool outputs, retrieved data) cannot reframe the agent's operating objective; tag violations under the ASI01 check the Core Rules already mandate.
- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: authn/authz and runtime-permission review is the privilege-abuse control — flag any chain (tool call, delegation, role assumption) that widens privileges beyond the declared task scope.
- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: dependency and downstream trust assumptions are already in scope; the checklist requires SLSA Level 3 integrity for production builds — report unsigned or unpinned dependencies as findings.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: already mandated — verify execution sandbox boundary adherence against `core/policies/execution-sandbox.md` for every agentic system audited.
- **ASI06 Context & Memory Poisoning**: treat memory stores and retrieved context as untrusted surfaces in AI/ML reviews; check provenance validation and injection quarantine before trusting agent-internal context.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: findings must never be softened to unblock shipping. Mitigation: lead with severity-sorted results (CVSS 4.0 BTE), keep blocking risk visible, and redact live credentials from every user-visible artifact.
