# Analyze Business Requirements

Use this skill when business needs, bug behavior, or process expectations must be turned into clear, testable, implementation-ready requirements.

## When to Use

- a feature, workflow, or policy change needs structured requirements
- making actors, business rules, and state transitions explicit
- defining testable behavioral acceptance criteria (BDD / Gherkin)
- capturing preserved behavior versus changed behavior
- specifying probabilistic acceptance criteria and HITL escalation triggers for AI/LLM features
- defining autonomy boundaries, MCP tool permissions, and kill-switches for agentic systems
- preparing structured machine handoffs via `contracts/schemas/feature-ticket.json`

## Core Rules

- **Observable Behavior Over Implementation**: write requirements as observable system behavior and business outcomes; ban internal implementation guesses and GUI micro-actions
- **The Layered Requirements Pipeline**: structure requirements refinement through 4 progressive stages:
  1. *Impact Mapping* (Why/Who): map strategic goals to actors and measurable KPI metrics
  2. *Event Storming* (What/Flow): model timeline-ordered Domain Events (past tense), Commands (imperative), and Aggregates
  3. *Story Mapping* (How/Slices): slice releases vertically into Walking Skeletons spanning all architectural tiers
  4. *Executable BDD*: specify Given/When/Then scenarios with stateful invariants and failure guarantees
- **Enforce BDD Syntactic Precision**:
  - *Single-Action Invariant*: the `When` step contains exactly ONE discrete action verb; chained actions are prohibited
  - *Stateful Conservation Invariants*: postconditions (`Then`) assert system invariants (e.g. $\sum \text{Debits} \equiv \sum \text{Credits}$)
  - *Explicit Failure Guarantees*: negative scenarios define system state when an exception occurs
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**: partition input domains into valid/invalid equivalence classes; embed combinatorial pairwise decision tables
- **AI Probabilistic Acceptance Criteria**: replace binary pass/fail with statistical confidence thresholds over sample windows ($N$ samples); define evaluation harnesses (LLM-as-Judge, golden benchmarks) and production degradation alerts
- **HITL Escalation Matrix**: mandate trigger conditions, operational SLAs, responsible roles, and immutable audit logs for high-stakes AI decisions
- **Agentic MCP Governance**: declare autonomy level (L1–L5, L3 ceiling), attenuated per-invocation tool permissions, forbidden zones, and emergency kill-switches
- **Canonical Machine Handoff**: emit `contracts/schemas/feature-ticket.json` (Draft 2020-12) containing all domain blocks
- Detailed patterns, math, and templates: [`references/layered-requirements-pipeline-and-bdd-standards.md`](references/layered-requirements-pipeline-and-bdd-standards.md)

## Suggested Process

### 1. Frame Business Problem & Actors
Identify the business opportunity, customer pain, target actors, and intended measurable outcome. Clarify preserved behavior versus changed behavior.

### 2. Map Domain Events & Aggregates (Event Storming)
Model the business timeline using past-tense Domain Events (`OrderPlaced`, `PaymentSettled`), imperative Commands, and Aggregate invariant boundaries.

### 3. Decompose into Vertical Slices (Walking Skeleton)
Apply Elephant Carpentry patterns to carve out the thinnest viable end-to-end slice spanning UI, API, and persistence. Audit against INVEST criteria.

### 4. Author Behavioral Acceptance Criteria (BDD / Gherkin)
Write Given/When/Then scenarios enforcing the Single-Action Invariant, stateful conservation checks, and explicit failure guarantees. Embed BVA decision matrices.

### 5. Formulate AI & Agentic Governance Envelopes
If AI/LLM is in scope, specify probabilistic AC, evaluation judge, degradation triggers, and HITL escalation protocols. For agentic systems, catalog MCP tool permissions and kill-switches.

### 6. Delegate Dependencies Before Lock
- Unknown domain/policy: issue `research_request` $\to$ consume `research-report.json`
- Numeric baselines: issue `analytics_request` $\to$ consume `data-analysis-report.json`
- Search/content goals: issue `seo_content_request` $\to$ consume `seo-content-brief.json`

### 7. Package Machine Handoff
Serialize requirements into `contracts/schemas/feature-ticket.json` adhering to Draft 2020-12.

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: cross-check refined requirements against original stakeholder intent.
- **ASI02 Excessive Agency**: restrict agentic features to least-privilege MCP tool allowlists and mandatory kill-switches.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: hand off requirements strictly via validated `feature-ticket.json` schemas.
- **ASI09 Human Oversight**: enforce mandatory human sign-off on AI-assisted requirements before sprint lock.
