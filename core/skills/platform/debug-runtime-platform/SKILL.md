# Debug Runtime Platform

Use this skill when the application code may be fine, but the running environment, rollout, or platform behavior is not.

## When to Use

- a service behaves differently across staging and production
- deployment health is unclear after a rollout
- the failure looks like config/secret/network, not app logic
- you need to compare desired state (git) with running state (cluster)
- a rollback or reconcile is required before escalating to app debugging

## Example (compare desired vs running on Kubernetes)

```bash
kubectl rollout status deploy/checkout
kubectl get deploy checkout -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
kubectl describe pod -l app=checkout | grep -E "Image:|Env:|Warning"
kubectl logs --previous deploy/checkout   # crash-loop before last restart
helm diff upgrade checkout ./charts/checkout   # detect git vs live drift
```

## Core Rules

- compare desired state with running state before patching anything
- prefer low-risk inspection before invasive repair steps
- keep source-of-truth drift visible
- separate platform failure from application failure
- get explicit approval before risky production actions
- **KUBECTL-TOOLKIT**: Use `kubectl describe pod` for events, `kubectl logs --previous` for crash-loop containers, `kubectl exec -it` for interactive diagnosis, and `kubectl top pods --containers` for per-container CPU/memory.
- **HELM-DIFF-FIRST**: Use `helm diff upgrade` (helm-diff plugin) to preview changes before applying — never apply without seeing the diff; use `helm get values` vs git values file to detect config drift.
- **AI-LOG-ANALYSIS-ADVISORY**: Pipe logs to LLM-powered analysis tools (Datadog Bits AI, Grafana Sift) to surface anomaly patterns — treat AI-generated diagnosis as a starting hypothesis requiring human validation before any remediation.
- **CF-WORKERS-DEBUG**: For Cloudflare Workers, use `wrangler tail --format json | jq` for structured log filtering; use `wrangler deployments list` to identify the exact deployed revision in production.

## Suggested Process

### 1. Capture The Runtime Symptom

Collect:

- what environment is affected
- what health or rollout signal is failing
- whether the issue reproduces only after deploy
- what changed in code, config, or environment

### 2. Compare Desired And Running State

Check the repo's source of truth against what is actually live:

- revision or artifact version
- config values
- dependency endpoints
- environment-scoped settings
- health or readiness behavior

### 3. Isolate The Failure Layer

Decide whether the issue is mainly:

- rollout orchestration
- runtime config
- secret or credential wiring
- network or dependency reachability
- capacity or resource pressure
- application code surfaced by the platform

Use skill: `troubleshoot-service` if the evidence points back into application logic.

### 4. Repair The Smallest Safe Thing

Examples:

- reconcile source-of-truth config
- fix environment-specific wiring
- correct rollout metadata
- restore missing dependency access
- roll back to the last known good runtime state

### 5. Verify Recovery

Confirm:

- rollout completes
- health checks pass
- logs stabilize
- critical smoke checks succeed

## Checklist

- [ ] runtime symptom captured
- [ ] desired and running state compared
- [ ] failing layer isolated
- [ ] smallest safe repair applied
- [ ] rollout and health verified

## Output Contracts

When this skill is invoked as part of a coordinated multi-role delivery, emit:

- **contracts/schemas/deployment-plan.json** — Required fields: infrastructure_changes[], config_updates[], and alidation_run. Set produced_by_role to the emitting developer role.

Skip emission for solo refactor work where no downstream handoff is expected.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: runtime agents and observability SDKs must be schema-validated against the expected manifest; treat unknown versions as untrusted.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: never construct debug commands or runbook entries from external content without strict validation.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: the incident report is consumed by SRE and DevOps roles; emit a structured contract so each role can validate.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: do not present a fix as "resolved" without the actual evidence; surface the residual risk honestly.
