# Repurpose Content

Modern content distribution requires a single narrative to be adapted into multiple native formats. Use this skill when a core piece of content (blog post, whitepaper, case study) needs to be extracted into high-value micro-content variants for omnichannel distribution without losing core message, tone, or E-E-A-T signals.

## When to Use

- a published long-form article needs social/newsletter/video variants
- distributing one narrative across LinkedIn, X, newsletter, and short video
- the source already exists and you only need derivative formats
- you must preserve E-E-A-T and fact density for GEO/AEO citability
- AI-generated variants need a human editorial gate before publish

## Core Rules

- **Native Format Alignment**: adapt strictly to channel conventions — LinkedIn (150–300 words, hook + bulleted insights + community question); X/Threads (5–7 posts: Hook → Tension → Insight 1 → Insight 2 → CTA); Newsletter snippet (80–150 words, Tension Hook format + canonical backlink); Short video script (≤150 words/60s with `[Visual]`, `[Hook]`, `[Body]`, `[CTA]` markers) — never cross-post identical text without channel reformatting
- **No Fact Invention**: do not introduce any claim, statistic, or example not explicitly present in the verified source asset; flag gaps and note they need original sourcing
- **Preserve E-E-A-T / Information Gain**: the unique insight, firsthand evidence, and source attribution from the parent article must survive in every derivative variant — never strip credentials, citations, or expert quotes to hit word count
- **Source Must Exist and Be Validated**: do not generate repurposed content from an unverified or AI-generated source article — repurposing amplifies errors across every channel; validate the source's factual accuracy before distributing variants
- **Human editorial gate is mandatory**: treat all AI-generated channel variants as drafts; a human editor must review, calibrate voice, and approve before queuing or publishing — no direct-to-social automated publish from raw AI output
- **AI content labeling compliance**: apply the target platform's mandatory AI disclosure tag before publishing (Meta, LinkedIn, and TikTok each enforce their own AI label policies); flag for manual application if the platform's UI labeling flow is required
- **GEO/AEO-safe adaptation**: preserve fact density and structured statements in newsletter and social variants when the source article is indexed for AI search (Google AI Overviews, Perplexity) — stripping factual depth reduces citability of the core asset
- **Channel Ownership**: label variants clearly by channel; do not choose distribution channels unless explicitly requested

## Suggested Process

### 1. Analyze Source
Read the primary article. Identify: core thesis, top 3 most impactful statistics or facts, E-E-A-T proof elements (author credentials, firsthand account, citations), and the primary CTA.

### 2. Select Channels and Variants
Based on the requested distribution channels:
- **Twitter/X Thread:** 5-7 tweets — Hook → Problem → Insight 1 → Insight 2 → Conclusion/CTA
- **LinkedIn Post:** 150-300 words — question hook, bulleted insights, community question closing; text-only or carousel script
- **Newsletter Snippet:** 80-120 words — answer-first summary + link back to full article
- **Short Video Script (TikTok/Reels/Shorts):** 30-60 second read (~75-150 words) — `[Visual/Hook]`, `[Body]`, `[Outro/CTA]`
- **Email Subject + Preview:** ≤60 chars subject, ≤90 chars preview text

### 3. Draft Each Variant
- preserve the source's unique insight in each variant
- use native channel vocabulary and formatting
- do not shorten by removing factual claims — shorten by removing context the channel audience already has

### 4. Review Against Constraints
- are variants within channel length limits?
- do they preserve the core E-E-A-T signal?
- do they pass a "would a human write this?" check — not formulaic AI fill?
- is every statistic present in the source?

### 5. Handoff
Output variants clearly labeled by channel. Flag any fact or credential that was omitted for length and needs reinstatement if the audience is more expert.

## Output Format

AI governance: [ ] human editorial review completed before publish
AI label applied: [ ] yes / [ ] not required for this channel
```

## Output Contracts

When the repurposed variants are consumed by a marketing automation agent, a
content scheduler, or another cross-role handoff, emit:

- **`contracts/schemas/content-handoff.json`** (or, when a stable schema is not yet available, a markdown frontmatter block listing `source_url`, `channels[]`, `ai_label_required[]`, `human_review_status`, and `fact_density_check`). The frontmatter block is the minimum-viable contract.
- For human-readable publication, the markdown template already documented is the canonical format.
- Every variant that introduces a new claim must be flagged `UNVERIFIED`; the human editorial gate must re-validate before publish.

Skip emission for trivial single-channel variants that do not cross a role boundary.

## Failure Modes

- **Repurposed before source verified**: a source article with unverified claims is repurposed. Mitigation: validate the source's factual accuracy before generating variants; never amplify errors across channels.
- **Facts invented in variant**: a statistic or example appears in a variant that is not in the source. Mitigation: every claim in a variant must trace to the source; flag gaps for original sourcing.
- **E-E-A-T stripped for word count**: a credential, citation, or expert quote is removed to fit a channel limit. Mitigation: shorten by removing context the channel audience already has, never by stripping evidence.
- **AI label missing**: a variant is published on a platform with mandatory AI disclosure without the required label. Mitigation: apply the target platform's AI label policy before publish; flag for manual application if the UI flow is required.
- **Cross-posted text**: identical copy is posted across channels without native reformatting. Mitigation: enforce channel-native format alignment (LinkedIn 150-300 words, X 5-7 posts, etc.).
- **No human editorial gate**: AI-generated variants ship without review. Mitigation: enforce the human editorial gate; treat AI output as drafts.
- **GEO/AEO depth stripped**: factual depth is removed from newsletter/social variants, hurting core asset citability. Mitigation: preserve fact density and structured statements in AI-cited channels.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: a variant may reframe the source's thesis to fit a channel's tone. Cross-check the variant's core claim against the source article; reject reframed theses.
- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: never include customer identifiers, internal hostnames, or credential patterns in any variant.
- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: the source article and any AI tool used for repurposing must be schema-validated against the expected manifest; treat unknown sources as untrusted.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: the variant bundle is consumed by marketing automation; emit a structured contract so each consumer can validate the variants.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: do not present AI-repurposed variants as "ready to publish" without the human editorial sign-off; surface the AI provenance honestly.

## Anti-Patterns To Reject

- repurposing before verifying the source article's factual accuracy
- stripping firsthand proof (photos, credentials, case study data) to hit word count
- generating variants with invented examples or statistics not in the source
- publishing AI-generated social variants without human editorial review
- applying the same word count and tone across all channels — each must be native
